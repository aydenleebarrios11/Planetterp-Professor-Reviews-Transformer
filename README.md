In this artificial intelligence project I built a machine learning model to predict professor ratings (1-5 stars) from student review text using natural language processing. I collected review data from PlanetTerp's API for five computer science professors, then used Hugging Face's transformers library to fine-tune a pre-trained DistilBERT model on this dataset. Through this project, I learned how to preprocess text data, split datasets into training/validation/test sets, and understand critical hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and dropout rate that affect model accuracy. I also learned about the trade-offs between different model architectures, how to prevent overfitting through techniques like dropout and early stopping, and how to evaluate model performance using confusion matrices and accuracy metrics
